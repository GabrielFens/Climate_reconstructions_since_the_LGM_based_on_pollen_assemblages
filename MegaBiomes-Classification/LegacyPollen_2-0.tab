Abstract:	This data set consists of the taxonomically harmonized and temporally standardized fossil pollen data from 3728 records. 1132 records are located in North America, 1451 records in Europe, 706 records in Asia, 191 records in South America, 164 in Africa and 84 in the Indopacific region. We expanded the previous version of the LegacyPollen 1.0 data set (Herzschuh et al., 2022; https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-3213-2022) with records from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database (https://www.neotomadb.org/; last access: August 31, 2022), Zhou et al. (2023; https://www.plant-ecology.com/CN/Y2023/V47/I10/1453 [in chinese]), Cao et al. (2022, https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16274), and our own collection for the Asian sector. The ages of the samples refer to the previously established LegacyAge 1.0 framework (Li et al., 2022; https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-1331-2022) and updated chronologies for newly added records. The 18348 original pollen taxa names and notations were harmonized to 1447 taxa names. We present the table with the harmonization approach cross referencing the original taxa with the harmonized taxa name. The harmonized pollen data are presented as counts (when available) and as percentage values. We complement the data publication by providing the source information on the references (most data are related to Neotoma) as a table linked to each Dataset ID. The data set and site IDs are from Neotoma if the data sets are derived from the Neotoma repository. In case of our own data collection efforts (Cao et al. (2020), Cao et al. (2013) and our own data) we used the already published PANGAEA event names in case they are related to the data or created own site names with referencing to geographical regions similar to the Neotoma data naming principle.
